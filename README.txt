This program is made for students of any kind to keep track of their marks in courses.
Since some Professors (or teachers) choose not to show students their overall average 
until the end of the semester, the program will do this and calculate course averages as 
students add marks. 

This will program will be done in Java with it's built in gui library and the serializable 
implementation for the database.
